Question : Consider the four core interfaces, Set, List, Queue, and Map. For each of the following four assignments, specify which of the four core interfaces is best-suited, and explain how to use it to implement the assignment.

Answers :

1. Whimsical Toys Inc (WTI) needs to record the names  of all its employees.  Every  month, an employee  will be chosen at random from these  records to receive  a free toy.
--> List. Can generate a random number between 0 and size()-1 and choose that employee.


2. WTI has decided that each new product will be named after an employee  but only first names  will be used,  and each name will be used  only once. Prepare  a list of unique  first names.
--> Set. For unique values.

3. WTI decides that it only wants to use  the most popular names  for its toys. Count up the number of employees  who have each first name.
--> Map, where the keys are first names, and each value is a count of the number of employees with that first name.

4. WTI acquires  season tickets  for the local lacrosse  team, to be shared by employees.  Create  a waiting list for this popular sport
--> Queue. FIFO. Use add() to add employees to the waiting list, and remove() to remove them.
